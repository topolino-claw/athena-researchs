# NAV and Bitcoin Treasury Companies: A Comprehensive Analysis

**Research Date:** February 27, 2026  
**Prepared by:** Athena (Research Agent)  
**For:** Fabricio Acosta

---

## Executive Summary

Bitcoin Treasury Companies represent a new corporate paradigm where publicly traded companies adopt Bitcoin as their primary treasury reserve asset, often using sophisticated financial engineering to continuously accumulate more BTC. The pioneer and dominant player is **Strategy** (formerly MicroStrategy, MSTR), holding approximately **717,722 BTC** (~$48B at current prices).

**Key Findings:**
- The market values these companies based on **mNAV (Market-to-Bitcoin NAV)** — a multiple of their Bitcoin holdings' value
- Some companies trade at significant premiums (2-3x+ NAV), while others trade at discounts
- The core mechanic is **reflexivity**: issue equity/debt at a premium → buy more Bitcoin → increase BTC per share → stock rises → repeat
- **BTC Yield** (growth in BTC holdings per share) has emerged as the key performance metric
- Risks include Bitcoin price volatility, dilution, debt obligations, and premium collapse
- The ecosystem has exploded in 2024-2026, with dozens of new entrants including GameStop, Trump Media, and pure-play treasury vehicles

**Investment Thesis:**
For investors seeking leveraged Bitcoin exposure through traditional equity markets, these vehicles offer an alternative to spot BTC or ETFs — but with amplified risk/reward profiles and fundamental questions about sustainable valuation premiums.

## 1. Understanding NAV in the Bitcoin Treasury Context

### Traditional NAV Definition
Net Asset Value (NAV) traditionally measures the per-share value of a fund or company's underlying assets minus liabilities. For mutual funds, it's calculated daily: (Total Assets - Total Liabilities) / Shares Outstanding.

### Bitcoin NAV (BTC NAV)
For Bitcoin treasury companies, **BTC NAV** refers specifically to the market value of their Bitcoin holdings:

```
BTC NAV = BTC Holdings × Current BTC Price
```

For example, if Strategy holds 717,722 BTC and Bitcoin trades at $67,300:
```
BTC NAV = 717,722 × $67,300 = $48.3 billion
```

### Market-to-Bitcoin NAV (mNAV)
**mNAV** is the key valuation metric for these companies. It measures how the market values the company relative to its Bitcoin holdings:

```
mNAV = Enterprise Value / BTC NAV

Where:
Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Debt + Preferred Stock - Cash
BTC NAV = BTC Holdings × BTC Price
```

**Interpretation:**
- **mNAV = 1.0** → Company valued at exactly its Bitcoin holdings (after accounting for capital structure)
- **mNAV > 1.0** → Premium to NAV (market assigns value beyond Bitcoin holdings)
- **mNAV < 1.0** → Discount to NAV (market values less than underlying BTC)

### Why mNAV Matters
mNAV answers a fundamental question: **"How much am I paying for exposure to $1 of Bitcoin through this equity?"**

If mNAV = 2.5, you're effectively paying $2.50 for every $1 of Bitcoin exposure. This premium must be justified by:
- Expected future BTC accumulation (BTC Yield)
- Access to equity/debt capital markets
- Regulatory/structural advantages
- Management expertise
- Options value embedded in convertibles

| 14 | GameStop | GME | 4,710 | $317M | 33.95 | 🇺🇸 USA |

*Note: Tesla's extreme mNAV reflects that Bitcoin is a tiny fraction of its overall value; it's primarily an automotive company. Strategy's current mNAV fluctuates based on market conditions.

## 3. Premium/Discount to NAV Explained

### Why Do Premiums Exist?

Bitcoin treasury companies often trade at significant premiums to their NAV. Several factors drive this:

#### 1. **Access Premium**
- Institutional investors restricted from holding spot Bitcoin can access exposure via equities
- Before spot Bitcoin ETFs (approved Jan 2024), this was the primary institutional vehicle
- Some jurisdictions still restrict direct Bitcoin ownership for institutions

#### 2. **Leverage Effect**
- Companies use debt financing (often convertible bonds) to amplify Bitcoin exposure
- $1 of equity + $1 of debt = $2 of Bitcoin exposure per equity dollar
- Creates synthetic leverage without margin calls typical of futures

#### 3. **BTC Yield Potential**
- Unlike static Bitcoin holdings, companies can grow BTC per share
- Management can raise capital, buy Bitcoin, and increase shareholder BTC exposure
- Market prices in expected future accumulation

#### 4. **Operational Alpha**
- Mining companies generate BTC below market cost
- Trading operations may generate additional returns
- Software/other business provides cash flow to service debt

#### 5. **Options Value**
- Convertible bonds create embedded call options
- Upside participation with downside protection (for bondholders)
- Complex capital structure creates valuation premiums

### Historical Premium Ranges

Strategy's NAV premium has ranged dramatically:
- **2020-2021:** 1.0-1.5x (early adoption phase)
- **2022 Bear Market:** 0.6-1.0x (traded at discount)
- **2023 Recovery:** 1.0-1.5x
- **2024 Bull Run:** 2.0-3.5x (peaked near 3.5x in late 2024)
- **Current (Feb 2026):** ~2.0-2.5x

### The Discount Scenario

Companies trade at discounts (mNAV < 1.0) when:
- **Debt concerns:** Market worries about ability to service obligations
- **Dilution fears:** Excessive equity issuance eroding per-share BTC
- **Operational problems:** Mining difficulties, regulatory issues
- **Bear market:** Risk-off sentiment compresses multiples
- **Management issues:** Loss of confidence in leadership

**Example:** Bitcoin Standard Treasury Company (CEPO) trades at 0.106 mNAV, likely reflecting:
- Pre-listing SPAC structure (not yet trading as combined entity)
- Uncertainty around closing/integration

## 4. The Mechanics: Equity, Debt, and Bitcoin Accumulation

### Capital Raising Strategies

Bitcoin treasury companies employ several mechanisms to finance Bitcoin purchases:

#### 1. At-the-Market (ATM) Equity Offerings
**How it works:**
- Company registers shares for sale
- Sells incrementally into market at prevailing prices
- Uses proceeds to buy Bitcoin immediately

**Advantages:**
- No discount to market price
- Flexible timing
- Continuous accumulation

**Example - Strategy:**
- "21/21 Plan" includes $21B in planned equity raises
- Regularly sells shares when premium is high
- Immediate deployment to Bitcoin

#### 2. Convertible Bond Issuances

**Structure:**
- Company issues bonds convertible to equity at specified price
- Often pays 0% or very low coupon
- Conversion price set at premium to current stock

**Why 0% coupon works:**
- Investors get upside exposure through conversion option
- Asymmetric payoff: bond floor + equity upside
- Company gets "free" capital

**Strategy's Convertible Portfolio:**
| Issuance | Principal | Coupon | Conversion Price | Maturity |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------------|----------|
| 2025 Notes | $650M | 0.625% | Variable | 2025 |
| 2027 Notes | $1.05B | 0% | $432.50 | 2027 |
| 2028 Notes | $800M | 0.875% | Various | 2028 |
| 2029 Notes | $3.0B | 0% | Various | 2029 |
| 2030 Notes | $2.6B | 0.625% | Various | 2030 |
| 2032 Notes | $2.0B | 0% | Various | 2032 |

**Total convertible debt:** ~$10B+ across various tranches

#### 3. Preferred Stock Issuances

**Strategy's "Digital Credit" Securities:**
- **STRK:** Series A Perpetual Preferred - 8% dividend
- **STRF:** Series B Perpetual Preferred - floating rate
- **STRC, STRD:** Additional preferred tranches

**Why preferred stock:**
- Doesn't dilute common stock (initially)
- Lower cost than debt in some structures
- Perpetual nature avoids refinancing risk

#### 4. Senior Secured Debt

Some companies issue traditional debt secured by:
- Bitcoin holdings as collateral
- Mining equipment
- Other company assets

**Risk:** Margin call equivalent if Bitcoin falls significantly

```

### The Critical Math: BTC Yield Accretive Issuance

For equity issuance to be "accretive" (beneficial to existing shareholders), it must increase BTC per share:

```
Accretive if: New BTC / New Shares > Current BTC / Current Shares

Example:
- Company has 100,000 BTC and 10M shares = 0.01 BTC/share
- Issues 1M shares at $500/share = $500M raised
- BTC at $50,000 → Buys 10,000 BTC
- New: 110,000 BTC / 11M shares = 0.01 BTC/share

In this example: NEUTRAL (break-even at current NAV)

If premium exists (mNAV = 2.0):
- Same 1M shares issued = $500M raised
- Still buy 10,000 BTC
- But: implicitly only "cost" $250M at NAV
- Result: Accretive to BTC per share relative to what shareholders "paid"
```

**Key insight:** Premium issuance allows companies to buy more Bitcoin per unit of shareholder value given up.

## 5. The Reflexivity Feedback Loop

### George Soros's Reflexivity Theory

George Soros developed reflexivity theory: market prices don't just passively reflect fundamentals — they actively influence them, creating feedback loops.

In Bitcoin treasury companies, this manifests powerfully:

### The Positive Feedback Loop

```

### The "Infinite Money Glitch" Narrative

Bulls argue this creates a "flywheel" where:
1. Stock premium funds Bitcoin purchases
2. Large purchases support/lift Bitcoin price
3. Higher Bitcoin price justifies higher stock price
4. Higher stock price enables more issuance
5. Cycle continues indefinitely

### Market Impact Considerations

**Strategy's buying power:**
- At $42B equity capital plan, Strategy could buy ~600,000+ more BTC
- This equals ~3% of total Bitcoin supply
- Meaningful demand pressure on a scarce asset

**Industry-wide impact:**
- Combined treasury companies could represent 5-10%+ of supply
- Creates structural demand floor
- Reduces available float

### The Negative Feedback Loop (Risk)

The same mechanism works in reverse:

```
BTC Price Falls → NAV Falls → Stock Falls → Premium Collapses →
Can't Issue Equity Accretively → Can't Buy More BTC →
Forced Selling to Service Debt? → BTC Sells Off More →
DEATH SPIRAL RISK
```

---

## 6. Key Performance Metrics

### BTC Yield

**Definition:** The percentage growth in Bitcoin holdings per share over a period.

```
BTC Yield YTD % = (BTC gained this year ÷ BTC at year start) × 100
```

**Why it matters:**
- Captures management's ability to grow BTC exposure per share
- Accounts for both accumulation AND dilution
- Allows comparison between companies regardless of size

**Strategy's BTC Yield claims:**
- Targets 4-8% annual BTC Yield
- Measures growth in BTC per share
- Used as executive compensation metric

### Bitcoin Per Share (BPS)

**Definition:** Total BTC holdings divided by fully diluted shares.

```
BPS = BTC Holdings / Assumed Diluted Shares Outstanding
```

Usually expressed in **Satoshis** (1 BTC = 100,000,000 sats) for readability.

**Example:**
- Strategy: 717,722 BTC / ~280M diluted shares ≈ 2,563 sats/share

### Forward BTC Yield

**Definition:** Projected future BTC accumulation rate based on:
- Historical run rate
- Management guidance
- Cash available for deployment

Allows investors to estimate future BTC per share growth.

### Days to Cover mNAV

**Definition:** At current BTC Yield rate, how long until accumulated BTC justifies the current premium?

Provides a payback period concept for the NAV premium.

---

## 7. Risks and Criticisms

### 1. Bitcoin Price Risk (Primary)

**The core problem:** Everything depends on Bitcoin.

- 50% BTC decline = 50%+ stock decline (likely more due to leverage)
- Debt obligations remain fixed regardless of BTC price
- Extended bear markets could force liquidations

**Historical example:** 
- 2022: Bitcoin fell from $69K to $16K
- MSTR fell from $900 to $135 (-85%)
- Greater than 1:1 leverage to Bitcoin downside

### 2. Premium Compression Risk

**What happens if premium disappears?**

- At mNAV = 1.0, no accretive issuance possible
- Capital raising becomes dilutive
- Growth engine stops
- Stock could trade to discount

**Triggers for compression:**
- Bitcoin ETF approvals (reduced access premium)
- General risk-off sentiment
- Loss of confidence in management
- Execution mistakes
- Regulatory action

### 3. Dilution

**Equity issuance dilutes existing shareholders.**

Even "accretive" issuance at premium:
- Increases share count
- Current shareholders own smaller percentage
- Future BTC purchases split among more shares

**The treadmill:** Must continuously raise capital to maintain BTC Yield.

### 4. Debt Service Risk

**Convertible bonds eventually mature.**

If stock is below conversion price:
- Company must repay principal in cash
- May need to sell Bitcoin to raise funds
- Creates forced selling pressure

**Strategy's maturity profile:**
- $650M due 2025
- $1.05B due 2027
- Ongoing refinancing needed

### 5. Interest Rate Risk

**Rising rates hurt convertible valuations:**
- 0% coupon convertibles less attractive
- Refinancing becomes more expensive
- Equity premium may compress

### 6. Regulatory Risk

**Potential concerns:**
- SEC scrutiny of capital raises
- Accounting treatment changes
- Tax policy changes
- Bitcoin regulation (unlikely but possible)

### 7. Key Person Risk

**Michael Saylor is central to Strategy's thesis.**
- Highly visible evangelist
- Controls significant voting power
- Any departure/discrediting impacts premium

### 8. Operational Risks (Miners)

**For mining-focused treasury companies:**
- Hash rate competition
- Energy costs
- Equipment obsolescence
- Halving events cut production

### Critics' Arguments

**"It's just a leveraged bet"**
- No unique value creation
- Investors could achieve same exposure with futures/options
- Premium represents inefficiency, not value

**"Musical chairs"**
- Works until it doesn't
- Last buyers in a premium contraction suffer most
- Zero-sum dynamics when premium shrinks

**"Unsustainable"**
- Requires continuous rising Bitcoin price
- Eventually, universe of buyers exhausts
- Can't issue into infinite premium forever

---

### Mining Companies Pivoting

Traditional miners adopting treasury strategy:
- **MARA:** Hybrid mining + buying
- **Riot:** Holding mined production + purchases
- **CleanSpark, Hut 8:** Similar strategies

Recognizing mining alone doesn't capture full reflexivity benefits.

## 9. Evaluation Framework: Treasury Companies vs. Direct BTC

### When Treasury Companies Make Sense

| Factor | Treasury Companies | Direct BTC | Winner |
|--------|-------------------|------------|--------|
| **Institutional access** | Easy via standard brokerage | May require custody solution | Treasury |
| **Tax-advantaged accounts** | Yes (IRA, 401k) | Limited (some ETFs) | Treasury |
| **Leverage** | Built-in via debt | Must use derivatives | Treasury |
| **Liquidity** | Stock market hours | 24/7 | BTC |
| **Counterparty risk** | Yes (company risk) | No (self-custody) | BTC |
| **Premium/discount** | Pays premium typically | Spot price | BTC |
| **Cost** | Brokerage fees only | Exchange + custody | Varies |
| **Simplicity** | Simple equity purchase | Requires crypto knowledge | Treasury |

### The Leverage Question

**Treasury companies provide implicit leverage:**
- Strategy: ~30-40% debt-to-assets
- Miners: Equipment financing + operations
- Amplifies both gains AND losses

**Comparison to alternatives:**
- Futures: Similar leverage, but rolling costs
- Options: Time decay, complexity
- Margin: Interest costs, liquidation risk

Treasury equity = "managed leverage" with management handling capital structure.

### When Direct BTC is Better

1. **Self-sovereignty priority** - "Not your keys, not your coins"
2. **Avoiding premium** - Why pay 2x for $1 of Bitcoin?
3. **Avoiding management risk** - No key person dependency
4. **24/7 liquidity needs** - Stock markets closed weekends
5. **Purity** - Want asset, not security

### Hybrid Approach

Many investors combine:
- **Core BTC position:** Direct ownership (cold storage)
- **Satellite treasury positions:** Leveraged exposure + institutional convenience
- **Mining equity:** Operational leverage to hash rate

### Cost Comparison

**Scenario: $100,000 exposure to ~1.5 BTC equivalent**

| Method | Entry Cost | Annual Cost | Premium | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------------|---------|-------|
| Direct BTC | ~0.5% exchange | ~0% (self-custody) | 0% | Requires setup |
| BTC ETF (IBIT) | ~$0 | 0.25% ER | ~0% | Simple |
| MSTR at 2.5x mNAV | ~$0 | 0% | 150% premium | Leveraged |
| Options | Premium | Time decay | N/A | Complex |

**Key insight:** Treasury company premium is your cost of leverage + management + access.

## 10. The Broader Thesis

### The Bull Case

**"Bitcoin is eating corporate treasuries"**

1. **Fiat debasement hedge:** Companies holding cash lose purchasing power
2. **Superior treasury asset:** Bitcoin outperforms cash, bonds over time
3. **Shareholder value:** BTC appreciation flows to equity holders
4. **First mover advantage:** Early adopters capture most premium
5. **Network effects:** More treasuries = more legitimacy = more treasuries

**Saylor's vision:**
- Every company eventually holds Bitcoin treasury
- Treasury companies are Bitcoin "banks" - borrowing fiat to buy BTC
- As more adopt, Bitcoin becomes corporate reserve standard

### The Bear Case

**"It's a giant levered bet with reflexivity risks"**

1. **Premium is borrowed:** Market assigns value that must be earned
2. **Reflexivity cuts both ways:** Upside loop becomes downside spiral
3. **Bitcoin must perform:** 4-year bear markets would devastate structure
4. **Greater fool dynamics:** Premium requires new buyers
5. **Regulatory overhang:** Still young asset class, rules uncertain

### The Realist Case

**"Valid strategy with appropriate position sizing"**

- Treasury companies ARE useful access vehicles
- Premium represents real benefits (leverage, access, management)
- But premium can compress - size accordingly
- Not a replacement for direct Bitcoin ownership
- Part of a diversified Bitcoin exposure strategy

### Game Theory Implications

**If one company does it successfully:**
- Others must follow or face "currency debasement" (holding fiat while competitors hold BTC)
- First mover captures premium; followers pay up
- Prisoners' dilemma dynamics favor adoption

**The adoption cascade:**
```
Strategy success → Metaplanet copies → More copy →
"Why isn't YOUR company buying Bitcoin?" →
Shareholder pressure → Board discussions → More adoption →
Eventually: Bitcoin becomes standard treasury reserve
```

### Macro Context

**Debt monetization environment:**
- Government deficits → Central bank money printing → Currency debasement
- Companies: "Why hold depreciating dollars?"
- Bitcoin: Provably scarce alternative

**Austrian economics lens:**
- Fiat money is broken
- Companies seeking hard money alternative
- Bitcoin = digital gold = treasury reserve asset

## 13. Analysis and Conclusions

### Key Takeaways

1. **NAV premium is the key variable.** Everything else flows from whether the market values these companies above or below their Bitcoin holdings.

2. **Reflexivity is real - in both directions.** The feedback loop that drives these stocks up during bull markets can equally accelerate declines.

3. **BTC Yield is the performance metric.** Investors should focus on growth in BTC per share, not just total holdings.

4. **This is leveraged Bitcoin exposure.** Understand that you're getting (and paying for) implicit leverage through corporate capital structures.

5. **The ecosystem has matured rapidly.** From just Strategy in 2020 to dozens of companies in 2026, this is now a recognized strategy.

6. **Premiums vary widely.** GameStop at 34x mNAV vs. Strive at 0.57x shows market is still pricing inefficiently in places.

7. **Convertible bonds are the financing innovation.** 0% coupon converts allow cheap leverage while giving bondholders equity upside.

### Investment Framework

**When to prefer treasury companies:**
- Want leveraged Bitcoin exposure without managing derivatives
- Need traditional equity/brokerage access
- Believe in sustained NAV premiums
- Comfortable with management/execution risk

**When to prefer direct BTC:**
- Want pure exposure without premium
- Value self-custody sovereignty
- Concerned about reflexivity risks
- Long-term holder (not trading)

**When to avoid both:**
- Don't understand Bitcoin thesis
- Can't tolerate 50%+ drawdowns
- Need capital preservation

### Valuation Sanity Check

**Is 2.5x mNAV justified?**

For Strategy at 2.5x mNAV:
- Need BTC Yield of ~10-15% annually to "grow into" valuation
- OR need permanent premium (access value)
- OR need Bitcoin itself to appreciate sufficiently

**The math:** If you pay 2.5x for Bitcoin exposure, you need 2.5x returns just to break even vs. holding spot.

### The Meta-Question

**"Are Bitcoin treasury companies a permanent feature of markets or a bull market phenomenon?"**

**Arguments for permanence:**
- Corporate treasury adoption is structural shift
- Access benefits persist (regulation, taxation)
- Management/leverage value real
- First movers establish brand

**Arguments for temporary:**
- Premiums normalize as competition increases
- ETFs reduce access premium
- Bear market tests structure
- Novelty fades

**My assessment:** Treasury companies likely persist, but premiums compress toward 1.0-1.5x over time as:
1. More companies compete
2. ETF access improves
3. Markets price more efficiently

Early movers (Strategy, Metaplanet) may maintain some premium for brand/track record.

### Final Thoughts

Bitcoin treasury companies represent a fascinating intersection of:
- Traditional corporate finance
- Cryptocurrency investing
- Reflexive market dynamics
- Austrian economic philosophy

For Fabri's projects and research, understanding this space provides insight into:
- How traditional finance is adapting to Bitcoin
- Capital structure innovation
- Market reflexivity in practice
- Institutional adoption mechanisms

The thesis works until it doesn't. Size positions accordingly.
