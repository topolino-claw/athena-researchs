## Executive Summary

Amazon's Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) is the dominant self-publishing platform, giving authors access to Amazon's global marketplace. You can publish eBooks (Kindle), paperbacks, and hardcovers — all through a single platform with no upfront costs.

**Key Takeaways:**
- KDP is free to use — Amazon takes a cut via royalty splits and printing costs
- eBooks offer 35% or 70% royalty options; print books earn 60% minus printing costs
- You can publish without an ISBN (Amazon provides free ones for print), but owning your ISBN gives you more control
- Pre-orders can build momentum up to 1 year before release
- KDP Select (exclusivity program) unlocks Kindle Unlimited and promotional tools
- The entire process from upload to live can take 24-72 hours

**Relevant for CPI book:** Given your economics book, you'll likely want both Kindle eBook and paperback formats. The 70% royalty tier requires pricing between $2.99-$9.99 for eBooks. For nonfiction, paperback legitimacy matters.

### Why KDP Dominates

## 6. ISBN & Imprint Decisions

### What is an ISBN?

International Standard Book Number — unique 13-digit identifier for your book. Each format (eBook, paperback, hardcover) needs its own ISBN.

### Your Options

| Option | Cost | Imprint shown | Can use elsewhere? |
|--------|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Free KDP ISBN** | $0 | "Independently published" | No, KDP only |
| **Purchase your own** | $125 (single) / $295 (10-pack) from Bowker | Your choice | Yes, any platform |

### Recommendation

**For serious authors:** Buy your own ISBNs.

Why:
- Your publishing imprint (brand) appears instead of "Independently published"
- Portability — can distribute through IngramSpark, bookstores, etc.
- Professional appearance for libraries and retailers
- One-time investment; 10-pack is best value

**For testing/casual:** Use free KDP ISBN.

### Imprint Name

Your imprint is your publishing company name. Can be:
- Your name (Fabricio Acosta)
- A brand (Liberture Press, etc.)
- A formal LLC (optional but provides liability protection)

## 7. Pricing & Royalties

### eBook Royalties

**35% Royalty Option:**
- No price restrictions
- No delivery cost
- Available in all territories
- Required for public domain works

**70% Royalty Option:**
- Price must be $2.99 - $9.99 USD (or equivalent)
- Delivery cost: ~$0.15/MB (average $0.06 per book)
- Only for sales to customers in eligible territories
- Must be 20% below print price if print edition exists

**Royalty calculation (70% tier):**
```
Royalty = 0.70 × (List Price - VAT - Delivery Cost)
```

### Print Royalties

**Formula:**
```
Royalty = 0.60 × List Price - Printing Cost
```

**Printing costs depend on:**
- Page count
- Trim size
- Ink type (black & white vs color)
- Paper type
- Marketplace (varies by region)

**Example (6"×9" paperback, 200 pages, B&W):**
- Printing cost: ~$3.50
- List price: $14.99
- Royalty: (0.60 × $14.99) - $3.50 = **$5.49 per sale**

Use KDP's **Printing Cost & Royalty Calculator** for exact numbers.

### Pricing Strategy

| Format | Common Price Range | Sweet Spot |
|--------|-------------------|------------|
| eBook (nonfiction) | $4.99 - $9.99 | $6.99 - $7.99 |
| Paperback (nonfiction) | $12.99 - $19.99 | $14.99 - $16.99 |
| Hardcover (nonfiction) | $24.99 - $34.99 | $27.99 - $29.99 |

## 8. Categories & Keywords

### Categories

You can select **3 categories** when publishing. Categories determine:
- Where your book appears in Amazon's browse structure
- Which bestseller lists you can rank on
- Reader discoverability

**Strategy:**
1. Research where similar books are categorized
2. Choose categories specific enough to rank but popular enough to have buyers
3. Mix broad (Economics) with specific (Monetary Policy)

**For CPI book suggestions:**
- Business & Money > Economics > Inflation
- Business & Money > Economics > Money & Monetary Policy
- Nonfiction > Politics & Social Sciences > Economics

### Keywords

You get **7 keyword slots** (phrases, not just words). These drive search visibility.

**Best practices:**
- Use full phrases customers search ("austrian economics books")
- Don't repeat what's in title/category
- Include related topics, themes, comparable authors
- Research Amazon autocomplete for ideas

**For CPI book keyword ideas:**
- inflation economics
- purchasing power
- federal reserve criticism
- austrian economics
- monetary theory
- economic indicators critique
- cost of living analysis

## 10. KDP Select: Exclusivity Trade-offs

### What is KDP Select?

A **90-day exclusive commitment** for your eBook. Your eBook cannot be sold or distributed anywhere else (including your website) during enrollment.

### Benefits

1. **Kindle Unlimited (KU)** — Readers with KU subscription can read free; you earn per page read (~$0.004/page)
2. **Kindle Countdown Deals** — Time-limited discounts with royalty maintained
3. **Free Book Promotions** — 5 free days per 90-day period
4. **Higher visibility** in some algorithms

### Drawbacks

1. **Exclusivity** — Can't sell on Apple Books, Kobo, Google Play, your website
2. **KU page reads** often pay less than sales
3. **Auto-renewal** — Must actively opt out
4. **Limits audience** on other platforms

### Recommendation

**For new authors in popular genres:** KDP Select can help build readership.

**For nonfiction/specialized books:** Often better to go wide (distribute everywhere) — your audience may not be heavy KU users.

**For CPI book:** I'd recommend **going wide** — economics readers buy books; they're not typically KU power users. Plus you can sell directly from liberture.com.

## 13. Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Pre-Publishing

1. **Poor cover design** — The #1 conversion factor; don't DIY unless skilled
2. **No editing** — Typos kill credibility, especially for nonfiction
3. **Wrong trim size** — Research your genre's standard
4. **Incomplete metadata** — Keywords and categories matter

### During Publishing

5. **Incorrect pricing** — Too high kills sales, too low kills perceived value
6. **Missing the pre-order deadline** — Year-long ban
7. **Mismatched ISBN info** — Title/author must match exactly
8. **Wrong file formats** — Always preview before publishing

### Post-Publishing

9. **No reviews strategy** — Books without reviews struggle
10. **Ignoring Author Central** — Free visibility you're leaving on table
11. **Setting and forgetting** — Books need ongoing promotion
12. **Not updating** — You can revise; fix errors when found

## 15. Decision Framework for Your Book

### For CPI: Consumer Price Illusion

Based on what I know about the book:

| Decision | Recommendation | Reasoning |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Formats** | eBook + Paperback | Nonfiction readers buy both; paperback adds credibility |
| **ISBN** | Purchase own | Professional positioning, can distribute widely |
| **Imprint** | Create one (e.g., "Liberture Press") | Builds brand across future books |
| **KDP Select** | No (go wide) | Economics audience buys books; sell on your site too |
| **eBook price** | $7.99 | 70% royalty tier, competitive for nonfiction |
| **Paperback price** | $16.99 | Standard for economics paperbacks |
| **Pre-order** | Yes, 3-4 weeks | Build momentum, coordinate with launch |

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Finish manuscript** — Professional edit recommended
2. **Commission cover** — Budget $300-500
3. **Buy ISBNs** — 10-pack from Bowker ($295)
4. **Choose imprint name** — Match your brand
5. **Format for Kindle** — Use Kindle Create or Vellum
6. **Format for print** — PDF with proper specs
7. **Set up KDP account** — Complete tax info

## Analysis & Conclusions

Amazon KDP has democratized book publishing, but success still requires:

1. **Quality content** — The platform won't fix a bad book
2. **Professional presentation** — Cover, formatting, editing matter
3. **Strategic positioning** — Categories, keywords, pricing
4. **Active marketing** — Discovery is your job

For economics/nonfiction books specifically, the paperback format carries significant credibility. Your Austrian economics audience is book-buying, not subscription-browsing — go wide rather than KDP Select exclusive.

The CPI book has built-in advantages: clear niche, defined audience (people skeptical of official inflation metrics), and your existing platform through Nostr and Liberture. The publishing mechanics are straightforward — the challenge is in the launch and sustained marketing.

**Bottom line:** KDP removes every barrier except the work of writing, editing, and promoting. The platform is free, the process is documented, and you can go from finished manuscript to live book in under a week. The economics favor trying.
